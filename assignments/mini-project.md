**Exercise 1**    
A few weeks ago you submitted a data set and associated question(s). Create a Github repository as we did this week with the inside of the class organization named "lastname-wordrelatedtodata". Include a script that reads in data locally or from url. In the Readme file describe the dataset and primary question you have regarding it.



**Exercise 2**    
In the Readme file for your new repo, write the a general plan on how you might begin to tackle the question and explore the data. This should be very general (not code).


**Exercise 3**     
Using the _Issues_ feature in GitHub, create an issue where you suggest something interesting to explore in your classmates repositories.
